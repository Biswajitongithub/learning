##Getting Started with SwitchYard
These labs were originally part of a SOA training lab at Red Hat Summit 2013.  The labs and guides have been updated to work with SwitchYard 1.0.0.Final.  There are four labs in this training.  Each lab has it's own SwitchYard project and associated lab guide.  The lab guides are located in the guides/ directory. 

####How To Begin
Start with the Lab Introduction guide sy-gs-intro.pdf.  This will provide some basic background on SwitchYard and links to required software to use the labs.
